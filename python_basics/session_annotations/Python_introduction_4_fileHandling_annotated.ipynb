        "\n",
        "File handling is an important aspect of programming, as it allows you to read from and write to files on your computer. In Python, you can use the built-in `open` function to open a file and perform various operations, such as reading from or writing to the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Reading\n",
        "Here's an example of how to read the contents of a file:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Open the file in read mode\n",
        "with open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as file_handler:\n",
        "    # Read the contents of the file\n",
        "    contents = file_handler.read()\n",
        "    print(contents)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the `open` function is used to open the file \"file.txt\" in read mode (denoted by the `\"r\"` argument). The `with` statement is used to ensure that the file is properly closed, even if an exception is raised during the execution of the code block. The `file.read()` method is then used to read the `contents` of the file and store them in the contents variable. Finally, the contents are printed to the console.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Writing\n",
        "Here's an example of how to write to a file:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Open the file in write mode\n",
        "with open(\"file.txt\", \"w\") as file_handler:\n",
        "    # Write to the file\n",
        "    file_handler.write(\"Hello, World!\")\n",

        "\n",
        "In this example, the `open` function is used to open the file \"file.txt\" in write mode (denoted by the `\"w\"` argument). The `with` statement is used to ensure that the file is properly closed, even if an exception is raised during the execution of the code block. The `file.write` method is then used to write the string \"Hello, World!\" to the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Options to open a file\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is a table of the options available for reading a file in Python using the `open` function:\n",
        "\n",
        "Option | Description\n",
        "------- | -----------\n",
        "\"r\" | Open the file for reading (default).\n",
        "\"w\" | Open the file for writing. If the file already exists, its contents will be overwritten. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
        "\"a\" | Open the file for appending. Any new data written to the file will be added to the end of the file, without overwriting its existing contents.\n",
        "\"x\" | Open the file for exclusive creation. If the file already exists, an error will be raised. This option is only available in Python 3.3 and later.\n",
        "\"b\" | Open the file in binary mode. The file contents are read as binary data and can be manipulated as bytes.\n",
        "\"+\" | Open the file for both reading and writing.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Other ways to open a file\n",
        "Python allows to open files in an easy and simple way, there is more than one way to do it and depending on the order and care you take it doesn't matter which one you use (but I will recommend you to use the `with` statement), here is a way to do it in which you must close the file explicitly after using it.\n",
